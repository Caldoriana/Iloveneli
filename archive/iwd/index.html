								<h3>üòΩ</h3>
								<p>Your never ending love for animals... especially the cute ones. Seeing you get happy whenever you see a cute animal has even strengthened my own love for animals, as well as my love for you. Everytime you get happy because you some cute little ball of fluff, my heart fluffers too... flutters*.</p>

								<h3>Your sharp mind</h3>
								<p>
									I know you keep saying you're dumb, or that I will find out how dumb you are, but yet you haven't managed to convince me at all that is the case.
									I still believe you are among the smartest people I know, who process things at an extremely fast speed. 
									I also know that I definitely do not keep up with it and I love it.
									Even if you have a peculiar way of processing information, it only makes me think of you as more unique and I love every part of it.

								<h3>Your knowledge and wisdom</h3>
								<p>
									I'm always surprised, even though at this point I shouldn't be, by how much knowledge you've acquired and how many experiences you've had to accumulate your fair share of wisdom. 
									I'm always humbled by how much you've been through and the way you've dealt with that, as well as the lessons you've learnt from it.
									Next to that I love how you always want to find out about things you are curious about, but don't have the knowledge of yet. 
									That curiosity and desire to research things is one of the qualities I definitely love about you.

								<h3>How easily you fall asleep</h3>
								<p>I always love it that you're able to just shut off your brain and start snoring. Nowadays I can only sleep at peace when I have you sleep with or next to me. To be honest, I really wanted to add the Skype gif so I just had to write this section ü•π</p>

								<h3>Your beauty üòç ü•∞</h3>
								<p>
									Most of these sections are about the beauty of your mind, but I needed to include at least one section talking about your physical beauty as well, even if you don't agree with it yourself!
									If there is one thing I know, it is that your sexy, beautiful, cute, appearance is a perfect match for that insanely attractive mind of your.
									You are the complete package, both mentally and physically ü´¶üíñ

								<h3>Your braveness</h3>
								<p>
									You've been through so much, especially with everything that has been stacking up. 
									I think you've handled everything like a champ, even when overwhelmed with anxiety, apathy, depression, fear, and other negative emotions, you've soldiered through and made all the right choices.
									I am so proud of how you've handled everything and decided to act in the extremely horrible situations you've been put in. 
									Especially when your support system isn't always the greatest, you've been able to keep making decisions no matter how scary and overwhelming they appeared, that takes an enormous amount of courage.

								<h3>Your honesty</h3>
								<p>
									Even though I sometimes struggle with it personally, it is defintely one of your biggest qualities and it makes you a great person. 
									It's one of the qualities that make you, you, and it makes me love you all the more deeply.
									I love how you are in tune with yourself, being honest with your surroundings, starts by being honest with yourself, and that's a quality an enormous amount of people lack.

								<h3>Your ability to forgive</h3>
								<p>
									I'm always amazed by how much forgiveness you have in you. Not just towards me, even when I make you look at me like the disappointed cat above quite a lot of times. 
									You still try to look at the positive sides in people and try to assess them as being human, which is an extremely strong characteristic I could only wish to match.
									I'm happy I get to profit from your ability to forgive, even though it always pains me when it occurs.

						<h2>I will love you forever</h2>
						<p>
							I know you're not feeling well, especially with how much discomfort and pain you're experiencing, as well as having to deal the plasters and desinfection and everything. 
							Me fucking up multiple times and not being able to be there for you or spend time with you the way you want musn't help either.
							I do hope, however, that I'm still able to convey a little that I will be there for you no matter what happens, and that I'll always love you.<br>
							You will always be the greatest woman alive in my eyes.<br>
							Happy (late ü•≤) International Women's Day.
