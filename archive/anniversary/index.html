							<h1>3 year anniversary</h1>
							<p class="major">
            I don't even know where to begin... With everything that has happened and that I've done, I'm not sure if making this is even the right thing, but I still wanted to do something for our anniversary, even if I might never show you. <br><br>
            The truth is that I still love you, I still hold all of our moments together as precious and I still think that you deserve the absolute best. These past months have been like a fever dream, I reckon for the both of us. I want to apologize again for everything that I put you through, I know how fucking hard it has been on you and how deeply I have hurt you, time and time again with my actions. I don't think I'll ever be able to make up for it, and I acknowledge that that pain will remain. I hate that I'm not more of a better partner for you that I can just make everything go away.
            <br><br>
            I don't know if we will be able to fix things, I don't know if we'll continue, or if you'll end up with someone who can actually take care of you and love you properly if I can't. However, I did want to at least focus on a little bit of nice memories for our 3 year anniversary. Maybe I'm just doing it for myself, but when I look back at the past 3 years, I still mainly see happy memories and moments, even if a lot of it got clouded by mistakes and misunderstandings.
            <br><br>
            So yeah... I at least wanted to reflect on some happy memories, I don't know if it's appropriate, but otherwise you can just choose to not read any of it

							<h2>Us</h2>
							<p>We don't have too many pictures together, but each of them is still precious to me. Most of the pictures we have taken together are somehow always on our vacations, or from when I visited you. These are still some of my favourite pictures ever, I loved going to Switzerland, the zoo in Belgium, visiting you was still a great memory. I for some reason especially love our shadows picture. It will always remain precious to me on having shared different food and places to visit.</p>

							<h2>Skappa</h2>
							<p>If there is one thing we have a lot of pictures of, it's Skapapa. I think both our galleries are mainly dominated by pictures of Skappa, but some especially hold more significant meaning. I still love the first picture of where he put his head on your hand. If anything, I will always consider you Skappa mama and I'm pretty sure, so will he.</p>
