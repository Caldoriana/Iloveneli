								<p>
									The more time we spend together, the more I realize how much my life has been incomplete without you.<br><br>
									Any moment we've spent together has felt like a dream to me and I still don't fully realize that this is actually real.<br><br>
									No matter what has happened up to now, the bad moments as well as the good moments, they have all enriched my life and me fall for you over and over again.

						<!-- now -->
							<article id="now">
								<h2 class="major">Right now</h2>
								<p>
									Even right now, I'm probably grinning like an idiot thinking I'm the most lucky and happiest person alive.<br><br>
									Being able to make you happy by just talking to you, pleasuring you, buying you gifts, patting your back, listening to you vent, having you explain stuff to me, or me explaining stuff to you, make me so absorbed in the moment that I instantly forget about time or anything else.<br><br>
									I feel like I'm constantly absorbed into infinitely small moments over and over again, and every instance just gets better and better.<br><br>
									I crave every moment I spend with you and any time we're apart I just think of the next moment we get to spend time together again.
									<a href="#future"><span class="icon solid fa-arrow-right"></span></a>

							<article id="future">
								<h2 class="major">The future</h2>
								<p>
									Even writing this section already makes me giddy and fills me up with so much positive emotions.<br><br>
									Just imagining all of the things we can do in the future makes me want to speed forward time just so we can instantly get to the most amazing parts. And even then I feel like I would regret fast-forwarding, because any small, little moment I spend with you even online is extremely preasure to me and I wouldn't want to miss any of it.<br><br>
									
									Some of the things that immediately make me feel happy just imagining it:
									<ul>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-house-user"></span> LIVING TOGETHER AHHHHH! </li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-couch"></span> Creating a super cute setup and decorating our place</li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-laptop"></span> Watching and gaming stuff together!!</li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-cat"></span> Raising our pets together</li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-calendar-week"></span> Going to fun events</li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-plane"></span> Traveling all over the world</li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-utensils"></span> Going to good restaurants and cooking you delicious chicken</li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-microphone"></span> Listening to you talk about your day</li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-venus-mars"></span> You know what this implies...</li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-baby"></span> Raising our children together omg</li>
										<li><span class="icon solid fa-heart"></span> And much much much much much more</li>
									</ul>


									I also made a small gift... <a href="#book"><span class="icon solid fa-arrow-right"></span></a>

								<p>I hope it's not too cringe for you... but I wrote a short fairy tale about us</p>
								<p>Don't expect too much though, I felt like this was the best way to express myself and even then the writing and story are pretty awkward so I can hope you can bear with it.
